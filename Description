**Project Title:**
**Basic Trend Confirmation Strategy**

**Description:**
Engineered a streamlined trading strategy in Pine Script v6 focused on generating only the highest-confidence trade signals by combining fast-reacting momentum indicators with strict trend confirmation logic. This system blends a 2-period RSI for sharp oversold/overbought detection with EMA crossover signals and multi-bar price trend validation to eliminate noise and false positives.

Key features include:

* RSI(2) and EMA(9/50) integration with trend strength gating
* Confirmation candle logic ensures price stability before signal issuance
* Dynamic in-chart alerts and background visual cues for intuitive monitoring
* Fully customizable user inputs and real-time market condition display table

Developed independently to serve as a lightweight, confidence-filtered signal engine for discretionary trend trading in my personal algo-trading portfolio. The code prioritizes clarity, precision, and signal quality over frequency â€” ideal for conservative swing and intraday strategies.
